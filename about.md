## Professional
Currently working as a Software Development Engineer at [Flipkart](http://www.flipkart.com) in Bangalore, India. I am a proud alumni of BITS Pilani.

## Technology
I like making things. My primary interest has always been in making new things rather than working on existing systems. I consider myself as a full stack web-developer, although, it has been sometime since I have worked in that area. 

At work, I currently work on Bid Data technologies. Before this, I have worked in logistics tech, and used GA to solve the inventory holding problems of a plant.

I am a strong believer in open-source. I don't work on anything to derive profits from it. I work on things for fun, or because it can help people.

## Music
I love music and everything that comes with it. I do covers and make own compositions. I play the drums, guitar and a bit of keyboards. Do visit the music section to find out more.

Also, I love movies. I would really like to consider myself as an amateur film-maker, but that would an over-statement. You can find my short film <a href="https://youtu.be/BKbS-rZXgU0" target="_blank">here</a>. We screwed up a lot on our first attempt, but I love the concept of the movie. I hope I get the opportunity to make more movies.
