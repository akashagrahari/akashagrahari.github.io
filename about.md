---

I am a Software Development Engineer at <a href="www.flipkart.com">Flipkart</a> in Bangalore, India. But before all this, I was a student of BITS Pilani. I love music. I picked up my first instrument in 2012, and I am still in awe of that moment. I play the guitar, the drum-kit and the keyboards. I love composing and am fascinated with how the computer can help a composer in realizing his full potential.

I love computers; and technology, and I like reading about them. I also love reading news, and writing my opinions about it. And, I hate the Indian National Congress. *Bite me!*

I am a big-time foodie. I eat a lot and I am proud of it. And I love movies. I would really like to consider myself as an amateur film-maker, but that would an over-statement. You can find my short film <a href="https://youtu.be/BKbS-rZXgU0" target="_blank">here</a>. We screwed up a lot on our first attempt, but I love the concept of the movie. I hope I get the opportunity to make more movies.
