## Technology
My primary interest has always been in making new things rather than working on existing systems. 

At my day jobs, I have worked on Big Data Technologies, Logistics, Full Stack Web Technologies, Microservices, Stream based event driven systems, etc.

I am a strong believer in open-source. I work on things which I see as useful or fun, not for the purposes of making money from it. Checkout the [**projects**](/projects/) section.

## Music
I love music and everything that comes with it. I make own compositions and do covers from time to time. I play the drums, guitar and a bit of keyboards. Do visit the [**music section**](/music/) to find out more.

Also, I love movies. I would really like to consider myself as an amateur film-maker, but that would an over-statement. You can find my short film <a href="https://youtu.be/BKbS-rZXgU0" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a>. We made this during our second year of college. We screwed up a lot on our first attempt, but I love the concept of the movie. I really do hope I get an opportunity in future to make movies.
