## Professional
Currently working as a Software Development Engineer at [Flipkart](http://www.flipkart.com) in Bangalore, India. I am a proud alumni of BITS Pilani.

## Technology
My primary interest has always been in making new things rather than working on existing systems. 

At work, I currently work on Big Data technologies. I also have worked in logistics tech, used Genetic Algorithms to solve the inventory holding problems for a manufacturing plant and worked in the web domain as a full-stack developer.

I am a strong believer in open-source. I don't have any inclination on making things for the purpose of starting a money-making company. I work on things for fun, or because it might help people.

## Music
I love music and everything that comes with it. I make own compositions and do covers from time to time. I play the drums, guitar and a bit of keyboards. Do visit the music section to find out more.

Also, I love movies. I would really like to consider myself as an amateur film-maker, but that would an over-statement. You can find my short film <a href="https://youtu.be/BKbS-rZXgU0" target="_blank">here</a>. We made this during our second year in college. We screwed up a lot on our first attempt, but I love the concept of the movie. I really do hope I get an opportunity in future to make movies.
