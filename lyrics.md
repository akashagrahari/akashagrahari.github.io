## #1

And I fall <br>
Out of bed <br>
And I can’t get back on it <br>
And dream again <br>

And now that I have failed. I can move on. <br>

## #2
When you’re in a crowd <br>
Searching for love <br>
When you’re in your room <br>
Staring at the wall <br>

When your pictures <br>
Drain out our lives <br>
When you’re in your mansion <br>
And watch the birds fly <br>

And if you’re alone <br>
Lying in a bath <br>
And you’re troubled with <br>
Your lies <br>

When the knife stabs you <br>
Like it slit our hearts <br>
When you stop dancing <br>
And my music dies <br>

When you have spent your life <br>
Wishing for the spark <br>
When you forget how  <br>
lucky you were <br>

When you change your soul <br>
Like changing clothes <br>
When you break the rock <br>
That you were resting on <br>

You will know <br>
You will know <br>


## #3
### Get up

I thought that I would atleast feel an ache <br>
But it is all very very plain <br>
Been ready for years to finally drown in mess <br>
But I just buy some food and sit on my chair <br>

If it’s not you then it’s going be someone else <br>
Don’t care for now I just wanna dig her chest <br>
Faces blurred and shivers down the spine <br>
Made her call my name and pretend I tried… to <br>

Get up <br>
Get up <br>
Get up <br>
And Dance <br>

Get up <br>
Get up <br>
Get up <br>
And Dance <br>

I am tired of being to whom you cry and weep <br>
You call me now but I don’t give a shit <br>
I tell you lies and try to get you off <br>
And thank my god that I am done and out <br>

Both of us thought that I was stuck in this <br>
And now that I am not, you look so stunned and pale <br>
I have got better meat and a better spoon <br>
Tell your sin I am done its his job now <br>

And he will <br>

## #4
### The Gods

All the Gods are here <br>
All the Gods are here <br>
Turn them on <br>
Turn them on <br>

Them on

You just want to say <br>
You don’t want to hear <br>
Kill those crows <br>
Tear those souls <br>

Now <br>

Fear <br>
Pious <br>
Lies <br>
All aboard <br>

Hear <br>
Cries <br>
Sighs <br>
Comatose <br>
Comatose <br>
Comatose <br>

Dont try <br>
Dont try <br>
To win <br>
So what what they say <br>
So what what they say <br>
Like a headless chicken <br>
In over my head <br>

## #5

A suit of molecules <br>
Sterile but free <br>
Eating and bored again <br>
Love and hate the empty <br>

I stopped all the dreams <br>
With flickers on the screen <br>
Scratch and screech to kill time <br>
Days got dark and nights got bright <br>

Free but sterile. <br>
An open canvas with nothing on it. <br>
No sorrow. Just numbness. Just empty. <br>
Autopiloting the day; <br>
And dragging through the night with the light <br>
Sex is mundane and that bitch is right <br>

A suit of molecules <br>
Staring the screen  <br>
Waiting for life again <br>
Eating and curing <br>

I stopped all the dreams <br>
With flickers on the screen <br>
Smoke my thoughts away <br>
Stroke your stick to feel <br>

Dont try to change it <br>
Talking business and acting sense <br>
I am tired enough but dont want it to end <br>
Covered in sweat and filth <br>
Bath tomorrow. Play and Repeat <br>
Don’t listen to them. You are the disease <br>

Underground <br>
Underground <br>
Underground <br>
Underground <br>
