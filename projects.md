* Automatic Tagger \([repo](https://github.com/akashagrahari/automatic-tagger)\) - Made this for a hackathon, to tag articles between a set of predefined categories. Very rough. Needs loads of improvement.
* Open Source contributions - Mozilla Firefox (readability), Midi.js, is.js

## Ideas Working/Worth Working On
* Web Application to provide an open source Synthesia like piano learning utility
* Using Beacons to solve carpooling problem
* WikiStream - Stream of Wiki articles. 'Coz who doesn't like reading Wiki
* Wolf 3d like game engine
* Game which uses the game engine - player navigates a randomly generated maze.
