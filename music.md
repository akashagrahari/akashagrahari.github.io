## Philosophy
I think that the bulk what you think and produce should be meaningful and should tell a story in one way or the other, and should strive to push the envelope of music as an art.

## Approach
I am always, and actively looking for contributions from friends and strangers alike. I am also actively looking to contribute to other people's tracks as well. If you are interested in collaborating, do drop me a mail on akash.agrahari@gmail.com, or connect with me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/akashagrahari2392">Facebook</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AA_isnowonline">Twitter</a>

I like working on the base of a track on my own and then invite people to pitch in for specific parts. I perform in Bangalore from time to time, but I am not interested in a long term commitments to a band. If you are looking for a drummer or guitarist who can fill in or a solo-artist who can perform on a per gig basis, drop me a call.
