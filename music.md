  I bought some equipment to record stuff after graduating from BITS Pilani. I always wanted to do that. You can find links to my Youtube and SoundCloud profile below and some recordings and performances. Do give them a listen. If you like them you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/classicguy1992?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe on Youtube</a> to my channel or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/akash-agrahari">follow me on SoundCloud</a>.

<!-- In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
