It sucks to be not doing anything really important or worthwhile when you have the skills. Well, at least some of them.

I wasted 1.5 years of my time between late 2017 and the whole of 2018 in the traditional sense of the word "waste". And since I have come to Pune, I have been super under-productive. I hoped to complete an album and I havent even started yet. I could blame it on the instabilities of my professional or personal life, but that's not the truth. Its just me. And I have always wanted to be super-productive and super-organized. Its this pressure that I put on myself to achieve those things, and when I dont, I feel guilty.

## What's Next
 
But I hope things are going to change now. I wish to take control of my life back. And I am not gonna put out some massive goals to achieve to do that. I am just going to regularly write whats up. That should work, right?

So this is what I want to build. Ultimate guitar type tab library for piano powered by midi. And a synthesia like interface to power the learning tool. There is plenty of free midi content available on the internet, and I think that can power this open platform, where anyone can upload a free or personally owned midi file and play it using the tool. Midi files sourced thus can potentially create a huge library.

I have been experimenting with the tech part, and my most recent experiments have been very satisfactory. Little to no delay or consistency issues while playing and monitoring midi files.

So there's that. I am gonna start on two parallel fronts. Will work on the data model and the overall design, while also working on the tool separately. Will probably make it like a plugin.

And through this, I want to get back into understanding a bit of frontend and javascript. It's been long since I have really touched any significant amount of JS. NodeJs seemed easy enough when I made a few simple projects earlier. Will need to dive into React soon. Why not just make it an opportunity to learn new things?
