***I have started producing original songs now. And I want these blogs to be the place where I dump what went through my mind, when I was coming up with these tracks.***

Around a week ago, I released the track **She(feat. Stefano Fioretti)**, and it made sense to me to document the journey of the song - how I came up with the music, the idea, and the lyrics; and what it took to finally record this track.

## The Piano

I suck at the piano. More than I suck on any other instrument. But I have a habit of coming back to it every now and then. My first love has always been the guitar, but there's just something fulfilling about playing a piano and singing along with it, which I never had with my guitar. Till now, I don't really enjoy singing while playing on the guitar as much as I like just fiddling around with it.

In 2013-14, I remember borrowing the keyboard from one of my friends at the Music Society back in college and trying to play and make sense of the instrument. I used to come up with things which now in hindsight seem trivial but were instrumental in me coming to terms with what the instrument means to me now. I confess - I can still barely play simple songs on the piano and I struggle to play any lead whatsoever.

## The Progression and the Arrangement

The chord progression was the result of a complete novice trying to get the instrument to play something musical. As soon as the chords clicked, I played the progression. The 8 + 3 odd time phrasing of the main piano riff during the verse, which may seem like an afterthought came out as smoothly as I hope it does in the final song. When I did realize that I was playing an odd-time rhythm and humming along to it, it made me like it even more because I felt that it enhanced the flow of the verse as opposed to what odd-times usually do to songs. I am sucker for situations when odd times enhance the song.

At this point I had an idea of what I wanted the song to be. Minimal, Atmospheric and Emotional. This was several years ago, so I had no knowledge or skills as a producer. I used the existing patches on the cheap keyboard and played around with EQ/reverb/compression to get the sound I wanted. Since then, I have had several urges to redo it again, but I prevented myself from doing that everytime. The rest of the arrangement is pretty much the first take I did - the strings and the choir.

## Outro Solo - The Collaboration

By this time, I was pretty much done with the structure of the track. I wanted the track to end with a guitar solo. I actively started looking for a guitar lead contribution for the track on soundcloud scanning through profiles of guitarists and listening to their original and cover leads and frequently dropping a messaged to them asking if they would like to contribute to this track. The positive response kept me going on but I wasn't able to find piece I was looking for. I went through several iterations with a few artists, coming close to what I had in mind but never getting fully there. Most of them gave up after the many iterations, and I don't blame them. I wouldn't beat up my head over an unpaid collaboation.

It was in late 2015, that I finally got the track which now features on the final track, almost in its entirety. Stefano came up with the final solo in the first response he sent me over. I was over-joyed. I could have nitpicked and maybe ask him to correct a few things, but I just loved the raw feeling of the solo, and the fact that he had actually listened intently on what I had in mind for the solo.

## The Idea and the lyrics

Life happened soon after. I got involved in stuff - Job and the routine of it all. And more than an year passed before I finally came back to the track. A gentle reminder from Stefano made me go back to the song. All this time, I had a broad idea of what I wanted the song to talk about and the mood of it all, but I never really got down to pen the lyrics. So yes, the lyrics came after the music. Way, way later!

Just as I was playing the piano one fine evening, I was reminded of the tragic story of [Tithonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonus) from the Greek Mythology, and that's what I wrote about for the lyrics. The song always had a narrative in my head, with the choirs corresponding to a dialogue than just music.

The first verse describes what happened to Tithonus. The second one is him talking to [Aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(mythology)), almost begging her. The part that follows that which could have had a chorus features heavenly sounds which in my head is Aurora replying back to him. And in my version of the story, Tithonus escapes his boon/curse symbolic by the build up and the final solo. As a few hours passed by and I developed upon the idea, it started to appeal to me in a broader sense, where Aurora could be replaced with something without which a person cannot survive, but which also ruins his life, in a way. I remember feeling this way about music sometime back.

## The Recording

I am not a vocalist. I have recently tried singing, but I don't like my singing and my voice. The recording was a pain. My apartment room if far from being acoustically insulated. I guess, that shows up in the final track, with weird gating issue in the vocals. I remained awake through 2-4 am to get relatively quiter surroundings to record my vocals. And me never being really happy with my vocals made this process carry on for three days.
