***Some offence is intended.***

So much buzz has been created around this. A muslim woman was allegedly denied an accomodation on the basis of her religion. And then there was another person who was allegedly denied a job because he was a muslim. And then there was a story that claimed that discrimination is not just against muslims; it's against hindus and christians as well. It seems so incredible when you read about it. Atleast the way in which it has been shown in the media. Discrimination like this is common, and many people go through this without giving much of a fuss about these issues. We can appear to be shocked, but we all know that this was going on.

<!--break-->

Only recently, most of the popular news channels were demanding a new law to counteract this discrimination. I have to say - I was more astonished at this than the actual incident. It's like their new hobby. The solution to all our problems; the holy grail, atleast according to our media, is a new law; always.

And why not?

It's so exciting and catchy!

<div class="message">
You wonder if such a law is even possible! I mean, what would you do? Would you force every landowner to give his property to whoever comes his door? It might seem weird but making such a law IS possible. Making laws are always possible.
</div>

Consider this. In the 70s, there was a huge cry about making sure that tenants were not exploited by the landowners. The buzz word was "Samajwaad". Basically, there were people who had lots of properties and then there were people who had none. So think about what a parallel argument will be? 

>A new law?

>*Yes!!!*

>And for what?

>Snatch landowners rights. And let tenants stay wherever they want.

Well, they got something very similar.

The Rent Control Act was instituted by the centre and had the following key features - 

- Control of letting and leasing of available accomodation to assist tenants,
- Protect tenants against indiscriminate eviction, and,
- Fixation of 'fair' and 'standard' rent... and blah blah blah

**What you need to understand is this.**

Rent control was conceived as a short term measure to overcome the problem of temporary shortages of housing accomodations. They were supposed to be temporary acts, but they were extended every few years. The rent was fixed as per the "standards" and it *did not change*; regardless of the inflation. The standards were modified but you know how slow these things can get. And we all are aware of the high inflation rates during the Indira Gandhi Regime (a maximum of 25.4%); and if a property was 20 years old, the tenant could not be removed from the housing premises. The logic being that the landowner has enjoyed all the benefits and earnings he can get from his property, and thus the property can now be used for *"Samajwaad"*. So, if a family started paying Rs. 10, say, in the 70s, they could keep paying roughly the same sum (say, Rs. 50) in the 21st century and nobody could do anything about it. The landowner could not ask the tenant to leave and he could not ask a higher price because it wasn't *"fair"*.

### So what exactly happened?

Firstly, there was a decline of investment in new rental housing, not just because of less rent, but also because of the fear of losing the house altogether. Real Estate was no longer seen as a means to derive profits. The number of available housing premises dropped drastically.

Secondly, there was a huge withdrawal of available rental housing. If a landowner luckily claimed back his house, he was more keen to keep it vacant than to rent to another party. This also started a trend of NOT having rent agreements to get away from this system.

Thirdly, there was accelerated depreciation due to inadequate maintenance. Probably, both the parties weren't really sure whose house was it at the end of all of it!

And when people started keeping their houses vacant, there was a drive to force them to make their properties available in the market again. Inspectors roamed about listing properties. They were paid huge donations by landowners to exempt their personal properties. Corruption touched new heights. And then there were State Development authorities building houses. But you all know how that goes. I don't need to go into that.

In addition to creating a black market in rental housing, the Act had reduced the accessibility of low income groups (which was the original point!), as they could not afford to pay large deposits to rented premises. The available premises invariably went to officers, judges, doctors, etc. Not to mention, this act also prompted an exponential increase in court cases having their origin in disputes over rented properties. 

And well, although, this was eventually changed in most states. A number of states like our own Uttar Pradesh just love this act and are showing no signs of giving it up in the near future.

It seems so hillarious now when you think about this. You are a landowner; but you can't do squat about it just because your property is old. So much in the name of Socialism!

**Coming back to the original point**, we do crave for a solution to this problem -  the problem of discriminating and not offering accomodation on the basis of religion. I am a firm believer that a law won't do the trick (I am open to suggestions though); it will only make things worse. There is the obvious issue of people just generally disliking people of the other group. Well, that is a social issue, and it can only be tackled through awareness and well... not naming and targetting each group when a news is reported... or when we are discussing election results.

The other issue is the legitimacy of police verification. Most of the people don't have faith in police verification; and well, they have ample reasons to feel that way. Remember the times you had to deposit *"chanda"* to get your passport verification done. We all don't feel good about it; even if it is being done well in some areas. The recent *"UBER Case"* is a flying example of this. The Transport Department made it clear that they had a police verification document forwarded by the local police which showed no problems with the records of the accused. A proper police verification would have shown his involvement in a previous rape case.

Most people *USED* to have their tenants verified by the police. And the initial reason why people used to look differently at groups of people is that they weren't sure if the person they were keeping as their tenant was legitimate or not. And that gradually transformed into a general hatred which thrived on generalizations of a small section of people over large universal groups.

Government needs to improve our faith in police verification. It will go a long way in solving these problems.
