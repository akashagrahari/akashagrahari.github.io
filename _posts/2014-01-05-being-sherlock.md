### *Spoilers Ahead*

Right now, I might annoy a lot of people. Some might even have been die-hard fans of the TV series [Sherlock](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/). I think that the [S03E01 episode](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2189771/?ref_=ttep_ep2) was just great. It was entertaining, thoughtful and nicely executed.

Why people didn't like it?

The first thing that people are ridiculing Moffat about is that he is taking an undue advantage of the fact that people are dying to hear the official explanation of how Sherlock survived. And well, we don’t really know yet how exactly he survived.

My view — Just be reasonable here. The writers of the show are clever, but there are a lot of clever fans too. They all figured out numerous ways in which Sherlock could have escaped death. And mind you, these writers are no Albert Einsteins! So no matter what they did, they couldn't have possibly lived up to the expectations of the public. No matter how hard the writers try, they never can. Even Nolan couldn't live up to the hype with The Dark Knight Rises. And I was awestruck by how beautifully they completely dodged that arrow altogether. I have to give the writers the credit. They weren't living in a cave. They knew what was going on in the social media. They knew about the theories. They knew how fans were going ape-crazy with the delay in the next installment. And they made sure they took full advantage of it.

To me, the writers are smart. They know how exactly to please the fans. They paid attention to their fan circle, which I must say is commendable.

I found it really amusing how they made Anderson represent the over-infatuated fan base of Sherlock; how they came up with the strange theories about how Sherlock survived. And the point when he just starts tearing up the posters on his wall is just hilarious. What could possibly be droller? (Of course except the “Sherlock being gay” theory)

They ended up making the first episode more comical than substance. And I don’t mind that. I don’t like when writers promise to be all intelligent always with their *intelligent* shows and then eventually release a dull episode. Sherlock attained super stardom in the social media, and that’s what is depicted in the episode. That’s how Sherlock behaves throughout the episode. The similarity is uncanny. And it was really important to highlight the friendship of Sherlock and Watson which was amply done so.

Things I didn't like —

The episode was overly dramatic at times. The text on video thing just doesn't seem to click for me anymore. It was refreshing watching it earlier. Now it looks dull. And the switch on the bomb thing was just too plain.

>^^ I can live with that. All in all, a tremendous watch.
