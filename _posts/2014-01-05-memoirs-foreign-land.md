My father was transferred to Calicut a few months back. We used to be in Bhopal before this and before that, we spent our whole life in UP. My semester ended and so I traveled to Calicut.

I came out of the airport. I had to take a cab to my home. My father had texted me the address. There were people in lungis all around and all of them were speaking Malyalam. I had no idea what to do. I took a chance — I went to the pre-paid taxi booth and booked a taxi. Not just, the guy at the booth, even the taxi waala was pretty fluent in English. So I did finally reach home.

I traveled a lot with my father the next few days. Had some really awesome food, the local cuisine. I had become a fan of the place. And people were very helpful. They had respect for lines and traffic lights (which was not something that’s common in North India). When we accidentally entered a one-way road, the traffic police person was kind enough to advice us to change our route. It was all very good.

Then my father had to leave Calicut for some work. Me and my mother were left at home for the coming weeks.

We didn't really know many routes around. But we had to occasionally travel to markets, banks for work. The auto-wallas weren't the best speakers of English. The common shops in the market place were torture for us. We found it really tough to ask for the things we really wanted. I have to say though, that the people of Calicut were almost always patient and listened to us.

A week has passed since then. I am always reluctant to go out. It really does take a toll on you to make people understand when they don’t know your language at all. And it get’s really irritating when my mother starts to bargain about the price when both parties don’t know the heck they are talking about. It’s strange though, that despite this, mother always wins. The Calicut people give in just to easily. Although, it works to our advantage, I don’t really feel home. I don’t know why. I am not usually the kind of guy who attaches emotions to things that don’t add value. I guess it’s just the language that breaks it away for me.

I have always heard that slogan that patriots all over the country shout about all the time — “Unity in Diversity”. I honestly feel the country will be better off if they knew a common language. I am not here to advocate a language over the other. I don’t feel I’m qualified enough to do so. Neither, do I feel that other languages should be discarded. I just feel that it will be a lot more confortable if people could mutually choose a language to learn. I guess it will even make work happen more fluently.

Only yesterday we got a an work mail. I called my father and he asked to me open the envelope and read it. The official letter was all in Malayalam. He then had to request the office to send in correspondence in English.

>Language goes a long way in making you feel connected as a nation.
