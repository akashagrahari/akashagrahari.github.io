This blog has been in a rut really. Nothing happening here. But I want to get in the habit of writing more. Have been slowly guiding myself into better habits - exercise, wake up early, being more productive. And now I should, and I need to write more often. So this is going to be a part of that endeavour.

Also, I have been really struggling to find new music that I really like. Spotify isnt helping. Last.fm is dead pretty much. I will have to take it on myself and go out there to find new music.

So this monthly (hopefully) blog is gonna list around 3-5 (maybe more, maybe less) songs or artists that I discover each month. Hopefully that would keep me pumped up. I wont follow a particular system or order. And no rankings please. Not that I am against it, but I am not particularly fond of them either.

## Warm Healer - Everything Everything

Man! I have no idea why this song isn't popular as hell. It's catchy. The groove in the song is undeniable. The vocal harmonies are a cool contrast to the overwhelming barrage of sounds you are going to encounter. The chorus is what really gets me into the song though. No odd time bullshit. The groove slightly changes to the account for the downbeats and opens up the chorus in the process (and breaks the monotony of the verse).

The breakdown is interesting. I initially thought it was just a post rock cop out but I have come to like it over the many listens. Good stuff

## Design - Utkarsh Varma

I am sure no one knows about this song. Its amazing how such a masterpiece can get unnoticed in this era of internet music. This song is sinister AF. The chords are amazing. It features spoken words by Alan Watts in the most non-cheesy way possible. It just fits. The main riff is so good. And while being mostly an instrumental, the title does make a lot of sense.

## Ruiselede - LV, Tigran Hamasyan

Oh Tigran! You continue to amaze me, surprise me, fill me with joy. The song is chill with a hint of edge which tigran adds effortlessly. The chords are just plain brilliant. And the beat is perfect. When the song does kick in, you know you are in for a ride.

The only gripe I have with the song is that its a tad repetitive and does not explore a lot. It could have been shorter perhaps.
