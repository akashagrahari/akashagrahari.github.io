I have been watching quite a few number of movies during the vacations. I asked my brother for suggestions. He told me to watch [Million Dollar Baby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405159/), a [Clint Eastwood movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood). I have watched many of his movies, mostly of which are quite old – The [“man with no name” trilogy](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_with_No_Name), [Dirty Harry series](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry_(film_series)), etc. And when I came to know that the movie revolves around boxing, I assumed that it would be another style flick as most of his earlier movies were. But I was amazed after seeing the movie. The movie is just too good, and too real. The movie is only as much about boxing as [Up](www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/) is about flying houses. The tool could have been anything; perhaps Swank could have been a high jumper. Boxing is just a tool to give a broader message.

>I like movies which don’t necessarily end at a happy note. I like to see movies which reflect upon the dark side of life, the side less travelled. It gives it a more realistic touch; it no longer feels fabricated. Not everything in this world ends with a smile on everyone’s faces.

*Million Dollar Baby* is one such movie. It’s one of those films in which the protagonist actually loses in the story; and it’s possible to lose in life – there are a lot more failures in the world than are successes; but we just don’t seem to think it fashionable enough to talk about it; and the loss that is portrayed in the movie is not one of those type of situations in which the person somehow wins in some symbolical way in-spite of losing in real life. This is a dead loss. There’s no happy side to it, just the fact that the person tried to give it the best shot.

There are many more movies that reflect upon this concept. [Scarface](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/), for example is a movie in which the protagonist loses everything by the end, his money, family, everything. He is a criminal in the movie and does all sorts of nasty things. No one can possibly sympathise with such a person. But, he is shown to have one good quality, one side where he retains his ethics, his soul; and this thing him leads to his downfall. It’s strange… to portray that you can keep winning as long as you are bad, but as soon as you touch the good side, you fall! Reminds me of the short story – [The Story Teller](www.classicshorts.com/stories/Storyteller.html) by [Saki](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saki).

There have been a lot of such movies, recently, who truly reflect on upon loss, sheer loss. Movies like [Requiem for a Dream](www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/) depicts the breakdown of people who are addicted to drugs. It doesn’t end by giving you a hope, that they might someday, rehabilitate; it ends in the characters getting infinitely lost in the addiction, to a point from where there is no return.

Subjects like loss, mental disorder and depression deserve a more human touch, other than just being blamed as a disease; and these movies have done a tremendous job at doing that.

More Suggestions – [The Hours](www.imdb.com/title/tt0274558/), [The Wall](www.imdb.com/title/tt0084503/)
